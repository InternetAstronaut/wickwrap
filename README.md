# Wick Wrapper for 1.19.4
I made a *simple* app with electron, it's the wick editor app, but as a `.exe`!

## Why is it open source?
I tought that people would think i'm giving a virus out, so i made it open source!

> [!CAUTION]
> Possible problem i found:<br>
> I tested the file, then next thing i know, the text cursor goes wind, i restart, and the repair menu appears?! I'm just warning, but i didn't put malware.
